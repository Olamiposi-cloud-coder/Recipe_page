## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./design/Screenshot%20(14).png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt more on how to use the Flexbox to level up my skill as a web developer.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<h3></h3>
and also the semantic tags.
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: var(--DarkRaspberry);
}
```
